## Workshop Title

An ideation workshop on mapping sustainability conceptions with free and open source software communities core values.

20th-23th of May, "Of Whirlpools and Tornadoes", [AMRO Festival](https://www.radical-openness.org/en)

## Short Description

We want to map the core values associated with openness and freedom, like it happens to be practiced in free and open source software communities, with some sustainability conceptions to explore, describe and discuss the relations of values.

## Outline: 120min Workshop

*  Part 1 (30mins): Overview and Q&A on sustainability conceptions and highlighting of certain sustainability criteria
*  Part 2 (15mins): Breakout talks with 3-5 persons in groups on 1 sustainability criteria in relation to core values of F/LOSS
*  Part 3 (30mins): 1 spokesperson of the breakout session reports in 3mins and each group has 2mins for q&a (overall 5 minutes)
*  Part 4 (30mins): Open exchange about decisions, questions, actions and wishes

Goal of the workshop is to interactively generate associative and navigable data models that describe the types of relations F/LOSS and sustainability communities will most probably continue to build.
